## DriveAID
DriveAID is a review/learning tool to help teen drivers improve their driving ability especially since covid-19 has had a significant impact in the education of new drivers.<br>
DriveAID aims to provide parents with a method of monitoring their teens driving ability through a concensual learning process by both the teen and parent to identify potential issues in their teen's driving.<br>
