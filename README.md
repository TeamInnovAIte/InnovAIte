## DriveAID
DriveAID is a review/learning tool to help teen drivers improve their driving ability especially since covid-19 has had a significant impact in the education of new drivers.<br>
DriveAID aims to provide parents with a method of monitoring their teens driving ability through a concensual process in which both the teen and parent can review emotional and gesture data from a driving session to identify potential issues in their teen's driving.<br>
